#Screenshot-tool

##create screenshots of web pages from the command line

Want screenshots of your pages? There are couple of options
1. `printscreen` (*lots of hassle*)
2. `browser extensions` (*works but has to be done manually*)

What if there are lots of pages to create screenshots? It becomes more and more tiring with each extra `html` page.

`screenshot-tool` automates this stuff, you don't really have to do any of this manually. Just allow `nodejs` and `phantomjs` to do that for ya!

###Getting started
1. clone this repo
2. `cd` into the `screenshot-tool` folder
2. `npm install`
3. Specify the path to `html` and `output` directories in `config.json` 
4. `npm start`
